  initial pass:
    can use a window to get the movie coordinates :P
    pure jruby: win32-screenshot, then BufferedImage, then hash, then display, with resizable window for display :P
	  then just display that single image
  
  
maybe someday do:
 
 can infer from the "general color" of the frame, as well?
 avoid sheering? [prolly unnecessary]
 
 can specify locations of monitors "3 monitors, one right, one left, one above" and use them and it actually work.

 what about darkened room, far right corner? 

 can infer the movie from the black stuff above, beyond
 
 can use a v shaped "sheet of aluminum" to split a top or bottom display into right and left sides.
   or up and down, or split it into fourths, or what not.
   
  can specify the location of your one monitor (right, above, etc.)

  the original goal was an awesome, immersive experience
    
	
  can do gradients, so that say washing sea can be display, or half and half displays, or the ground too.
  
notes:

Do people usually watch it in the complete dark?
  What's the implication?  Just do the walls in that case?
